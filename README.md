### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Hi, I'm Marcos Iglesias!
>A Staff frontend engineer delivering features that users love by mentoring, designing, and building data-driven products.

I have fourteen years of experience developing web applications with frontend technologies in different fields, including events, transportation, e-commerce, online banking, and SaaS platforms.

Passionate about **mentoring**, I love training the team in agile engineering practices such as code reviews, test-driven development, story mapping, and pairing.

On top of all that, I enjoy creating and maintaining **Open Source Software** like [Britecharts](https://github.com/britecharts/britecharts) (charting library) and [Amundsen](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen) (Data discovery and catalog). 

I am also a **speaker** and **author** of ["Pro D3.js" for APress]([url](https://www.amazon.com/Pro-D3-js-Maintainable-Modular-Testable/dp/1484252020)).
